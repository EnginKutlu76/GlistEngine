## Installation

### I. Installation For Students

GlistEngine has one-click installer for Windows, you can download it from [https://www.glistengine.com/download](https://www.glistengine.com/download)
Please keep in mind that this installer might not always have the latest version of the engine. For students, this is usually enough.

### II. Installation For Developers

We suggest using the installation scripts instead of manually installing the engine, here are the links for automated installation scripts.
These scripts might not always work, if you have issues installing please feel free to create an issue via https://github.com/GlistEngine/GlistEngine/issues.

- Windows Install Script
    - Open up a powershell terminal and run this command to install GlistEngine:
    ```bash
    irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlistEngine/InstallScripts/main/scripts/windows/install-glist.ps1" | iex
    ```
- Mac Install Script (Intel and Apple Silicon)
    - Open up a terminal and run this command to install GlistEngine:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlistEngine/InstallScripts/main/scripts/macos/install-glist.sh)"
    ```
- Linux Install Script
    - Open up a terminal and run this command to install GlistEngine:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlistEngine/InstallScripts/main/scripts/linux/install-glist.sh)"
    ```

If you'd rather install manually instead of using the script, follow the instructions for your platform:
 - [Windows](./INSTALLATION-WIN.md)
 - [macOS](./INSTALLATION-MACOS.md)
 - [Linux](./INSTALLATION-LINUX.md)

## Getting Started
See [GETTING-STARTED.md](./GETTING-STARTED.md) for platform-specific launch instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Unresolved Inclusions

If you see "Unresolved Inclusion" errors on the editor, that means the ide lost the pre-determined include path entries.

- Click Project->Clean Project to clean previous build
- Click hammer button to rebuild the project.
- Click Project->C/C++ Index->Rebuild to invoke indexer.

Then the "Unresolved Inclusion" errors should be gone.
